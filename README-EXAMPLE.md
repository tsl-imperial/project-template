   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/02-analysis.ipynb
   ```

3. [Continue with additional steps...]

**Note:** [Add any important notes about data files, such as:]
- Data files should be placed in the `data/` folder
- Download data from [source/URL] if not included
- [Any other setup notes]

[Optional: Include command-line instructions if you have Python scripts]
```bash
python src/your_script.py
```
